# akamai-devops-library
This repository contains code snippets, procedures, and other building blocks you can reuse in your Akamai configuration. 

This resource is for Akamai customers and employees so that they can find and submit examples of reusable functionality, helping you configure the service faster, and without friction. These examples include both using the Akamai console UI and APIs. 

Enjoy!
